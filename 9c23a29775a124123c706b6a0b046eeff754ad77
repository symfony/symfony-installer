@1ed absolutely amazing! Your proposal is undoubtedly much better. Thanks a lot!

A bit related to this: for the new Symfony Console Style Guide I tried first to use some fancy UTF-8 characters but then I realized that I was completely wrong. The new idea is to use a style that is very close to this proposal.
