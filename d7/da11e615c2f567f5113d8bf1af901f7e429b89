ping @symfony/deciders

This seems to cause issues for people not familiar with the platform config in Composer (see https://github.com/composer/composer/issues/4319#issuecomment-180273853).

Does this result in a warning that "composer.json is not in sync with lock file"? Or is this config option not considered for this sync check by composer?

The lock file is synchronised after the `composer.json` file has been changed: https://github.com/xabbuh/symfony-installer/blob/issue-234/src/Symfony/Installer/NewCommand.php#L371

Just FYI https://github.com/composer/composer/pull/4881 should solve the confusion side.. I'd argue having platform config is a good thing but obviously if people don't take care of setting it correctly it's a bad idea, so maybe not having one by default is better.

@Seldaek but having it set to 5.3 in new Symfony 2.8 projects is not a good idea. symfony standard-edition needs this value because of its min supported version, but I hope new projects actually target higher PHP runtimes when deploying.
So keeping the Symfony setting is not a good idea. People needing this setting would need to configure it according to their need anyway. and relying on the current runtime is a better behavior for people not aware of this composer feature.

So :+1: for this change

@javiereguiluz What do you think?

I think it can be merged now and released for newcomers to avoid this issue :+1:
