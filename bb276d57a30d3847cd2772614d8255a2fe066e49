@Ma27 thanks for preparing this PR. I have a question about it: should we apply the new method to the entire package name instead of just to the vendor part? Thanks.

well actually you are right.
I would remove the following lines https://github.com/Ma27/symfony-installer/blob/patch-1/src/Symfony/Installer/NewCommand.php#L379-L380 and apply the fixComposerVendorName to the whole package name and attach this commit to the pull request

@javiereguiluz we should generate lowercase package names. Composer will treat them as lowercase anyway.

With the latest changes I think this is ready to merge it because now we generate lowercased and dash-separated package names. Thanks @Ma27 for working on this!
