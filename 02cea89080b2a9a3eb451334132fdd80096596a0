@javiereguiluz can you fix the testsuite ?

The error is caused by the infamous Symfony error that left the `-DEV` suffix in the version number (https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/18390 & related). What's the best approach to solve this in our test suite?

Let's merge this as is and then we'll think about how to fix our test suite. Thanks!
