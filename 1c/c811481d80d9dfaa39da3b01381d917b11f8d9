If you want, we can make `lts` version name to work on symfony.com. We already do this for `latest` version name and it would be really easy to do. This way we could simplify a lot the code of this PR. What do you think?

@javiereguiluz exactly what i asked for @stof

> can you please just explain me this:
> http://symfony.com/download?v=Symfony_Standard_Vendors_latest => can be resolved
> http://symfony.com/download?v=Symfony_Standard_Vendors_lts => can not be resolved
> it will be easier (and no more query call for json for the lts) if it is resolved correctly :)

This could reduce this PR to two lines of code, I think it's worth the cost :smiley:

OK. The `lts` version is already supported in symfony.com. But we must wait for the related pull request to get approved and deployed in the production website. I'll keep you posted.

@javiereguiluz Will that be the latest LTS once Symfony 2.7 is released?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by javiereguiluz at 2015-02-20T14:28:19Z

@xabbuh yes. It will always point to the most recent LTS version, whichever it is.

@94noni can you update the PR so that it simply handle ``lts`` in the same way than ``latest`` (which should indeed be a 2 lines patch), even if the archive is not yet in production (it only means we have to wait before merging, but it does not prevent to have the patch ready)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by 94noni at 2015-02-20T14:31:37Z

Thank all of you, waiting your go to change this (and PR on the related symfony documentation)
Edit: ok lets do that, I reverted the code

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by stof at 2015-02-20T15:22:25Z

Can you revert the other changes being done here to really keep it a 2-line patch (well, maybe 4 because of formatting)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by 94noni at 2015-02-20T15:34:28Z

@stof PR finalized, much cleaner with the symfony.com lts version supported now

:+1:

by 94noni at 2015-02-20T16:21:25Z

Just forget the read me. Updated now

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by javiereguiluz at 2015-02-21T09:23:31Z

The special `lts` version name is already available in production:

```
http://symfony.com/download?v=Symfony_Standard_Vendors_lts.zip
http://symfony.com/download?v=Symfony_Standard_Vendors_lts.tgz
```

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by stof at 2015-02-27T14:21:37Z

:+1: then

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cool :)
And is it ok for the https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/5032 as well?
