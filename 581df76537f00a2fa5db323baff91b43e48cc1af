:+1:  works well for me
```
$ php symfony.phar
Symfony Installer requires PHP 5.4 version or higher and your system has
PHP 5.3.3 version installed.

To solve this issue, upgrade your PHP installation or install Symfony manually
executing the following command:

composer create-project symfony/framework-standard-edition <project-name> <symfony-version>
```

Maybe you should remove the other check in the command.
