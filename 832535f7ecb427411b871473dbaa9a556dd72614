@javiereguiluz just a small note: it would be better to send PRs from a fork rather than from the main repo, to avoid having the feature branches in it

@stof you are right. I'm sorry.

wouldn't it be better to match the version once with capturing groups for the minor and patch versions, and then to apply conditions on them rather than doing more regex matches ?

@stof I agree that your proposal is more correct, but I find this solution more readable. Therefore, before any change, I'd like to wait for some more opinions about this.
