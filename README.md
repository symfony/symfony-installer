Symfony Installer
=================

**This is the official installer to start new projects based on the Symfony 
full-stack framework.**

Installing the installer
------------------------

This step is only needed the first time you use the installer:

### Linux and Mac OS X

```bash
$ sudo curl -LsS https://symfony.com/installer -o /usr/local/bin/symfony
$ sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/symfony
```

### Windows

```bash
c:\> php -r "readfile('https://symfony.com/installer');" > symfony
```

Move the downloaded `symfony` file to your projects directory and execute
it as follows:

```bash
c:\> php symfony
```

Using the installer
-------------------

**1. Start a new project with the latest stable Symfony version**

Execute the `new` command and provide the name of your project as the only
argument:

```bash
# Linux, Mac OS X
$ symfony new my_project

# Windows
c:\> php symfony new my_project
```

**2. Start a new project with the latest Symfony LTS (Long Term Support) version**

Execute the `new` command and provide the name of your project as the first
argument and `lts` as the second argument. The installer will automatically
select the most recent LTS (*Long Term Support*) version available:

```bash
# Linux, Mac OS X
$ symfony new my_project lts

# Windows
c:\> php symfony new my_project lts
```

**3. Start a new project based on a specific Symfony branch**

Execute the `new` command and provide the name of your project as the first
argument and the branch number as the second argument. The installer will
automatically select the most recent version available for the given branch:

```bash
# Linux, Mac OS X
$ symfony new my_project 2.3

# Windows
c:\> php symfony new my_project 2.3
```

**4. Start a new project based on a specific Symfony version**

Execute the `new` command and provide the name of your project as the first
argument and the exact Symfony version as the second argument:

```bash
# Linux, Mac OS X
$ symfony new my_project 2.5.6

# Windows
c:\> php symfony new my_project 2.5.6
```

Updating the installer
----------------------

New versions of the Symfony Installer are released regularly. To update your
installer version, execute the following command:

```bash
# Linux, Mac OS X
$ symfony self-update

# Windows
c:\> php symfony self-update
```

> **NOTE**
>
> If your system requires the use of a proxy server to download contents, the
> installer tries to guess the best proxy settings from the `HTTP_PROXY` and
> `http_proxy` environment variables. Make sure any of them is set before
> executing the Symfony Installer.
