You will now have to skip some tests when on PHP 5.4.

@xabbuh yes. I did that in a80196a ... but there are other failing tests which I can't fix. I'll try to fix them tomorrow.

This is now ready for the final review. Thanks!

Should we make it possible to skip the version check to be able to bootstrap a project even on a system that isn't fully ready to run the application itself?

@xabbuh I'd prefer to keep failing if your system is not ready to run the Symfony version you want to install.

I think this needs more work. If you don't pass any version, you are using `latest`, which bypasses this new check, although it also requires 5.5.9.

This is now ready for a new review. I changed everything about how we decide if a version is installable.
