I'd like to merge this change soon because I want to test it well before we enter into the most intense release period in Symfony history (including a major version change). Please add any comment or review that you may have. Thanks!

@javiereguiluz SO we can now download archives of all beta versions? Does this include all beta versions that have been released in the past?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@xabbuh yes, we can download any past beta package. For example:

```bash
$ symfony new my_project 2.6.0-BETA1
```

:+1: as is - it'll be great to be able to show people how to create a new beta project for testing when the beta's are released.

After @xabbuh's comments, I can confirm that Composer is case insensitive at least on Mac OS. These commands result in the same installation:

```
$ composer create-project symfony/framework-standard-edition my_project 2.7.0-BETA1
$ composer create-project symfony/framework-standard-edition my_project 2.7.0-beta1
```

That's why in 31765ca I've changed all `dev` and `BETA` comparisons to case insentivity. I'll merge this last version unless someone tells me not to. Thanks!

it is on all systems. It normalizes the case of stability specifiers: https://github.com/composer/composer/blob/15face5432d7b7334db6ac69fac0190971cafa6e/src/Composer/Package/Version/VersionParser.php#L49

@javiereguiluz what about ``RC`` versions ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@javiereguiluz shouldn't you normalize the case of ``BETA`` for the generated archive URL though ? Or is it case insensitive on the server too ?

In https://github.com/symfony/symfony-installer/commit/b26b217c24c6ee713694e633391c2ac5f6af24ca I've added support for RC versions and I've normalized the version names before downloading them from the server.

@xabbuh thanks for the review. I'm gonna merge it now, so we have time to test it well before the 2.8.0-BETA1 release. Thanks!
