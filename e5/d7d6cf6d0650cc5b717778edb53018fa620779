IMHO, we should just add a mention at the top of the README mentioning that from 3.4 on, using Flex is better and that Symfony 4.0+ won't be supported by the installer. But for all other versions (that are still supported), the installer is still the recommended tool.

See http://symfony.com/blog/the-end-of-the-symfony-installer for the blog post announcing this.
