:+1: @raulfraile thanks a lot for this! I really wanted to provide more detailed error messages and your PR solved that perfectly.

By the way, thanks for the shortcut to provide different extensions for the same file. I loved that little detail!

@xabbuh I just changed the use statements to use one for each class/exception. Thanks!

@raulfraile no pressure here, but it would be great if you could find some time in the coming days to address the minor comments pointed by @xabbuh. Thanks!
