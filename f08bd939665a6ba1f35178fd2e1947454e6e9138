@tvlooy thanks for reporting this error! We've tackled it in this related PR in the symfony repo: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/12524

It should be fixed for new Symfony versions, but anyway, we probably need to change the message because it's not gonna work with older Symfony versions.

@tvlooy to make this PR ready to be merged, we need two changes from you:

  * Remove the `src/Symfony/Installer/NewCommand.php~` temp. file which was accidentally committed.
  * Fix the minor code syntax error reported here: http://fabbot.io/report/symfony/symfony-installer/45/a4ec60afea03c0761311150b8987e85870c92ad8

@tvlooy I suggest you to use a global ignore file to always avoid commiting the backup file of your IDE. See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/ for the way to do it

@javiereguiluz @stof whoops, thanks for pointing this out. I normally don't use gedit to do these kind of edits, but added in my global gitignore nonetheless
