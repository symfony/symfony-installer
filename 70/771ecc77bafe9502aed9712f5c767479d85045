please revert the permission change. This file has no reason to be executable.

If you are using Windows, see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1580596/how-do-i-make-git-ignore-file-mode-chmod-changes for the way to tell git to ignore them (as Windows does not support Unix permissions). I think GitBash configures this by default, but maybe not other installers.
