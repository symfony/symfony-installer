Just a quick suggestion: Instead of copying a lot of code from the `new` command, we should probably some parts to a dedicated layer and reuse it in both commands. As a benefit, this would probably also ease testing them quite a lot (I still need to wrap up my pull request though).

@xabbuh what would you think if I make the `DemoCommand` inherit from the `NewCommand`?

In this case, an abstract base command class would probably be better.

@xabbuh I've updated this PR to introduce the common abstract method.
