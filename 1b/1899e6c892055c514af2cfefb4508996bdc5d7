Voil√† ! Relied on the `json()` method from the `ResponseInterface`, in order to facilitate the modification of the Guzzle's Response.

I think we're good for this issue, aren't we ?

Fixed @stof's note about the regexp :)

We should probably provide a sensible error message if the installer wasn't able to find the latest patch version.

@xabbuh Here it is :) I added the message only when `$versionsList` is not empty, because if it is, it means that Guzzle couldn't connect to `symfony.com`, so the user won't be able to download Symfony anyway.

Hi @xabbuh , is this PR ok for merging ? :smile:

@Pierstoval I'm not the one to decide, but to me it looks ready. :)

Fine, thanks ! We'll just wait for it to be merged, I think it's an awesome feature !
I just installed a new SF2.6 app some days ago and was surprised that I couldn't do "new app/ 2.6" , when I remembered that it was only available in my local machine :laughing:
