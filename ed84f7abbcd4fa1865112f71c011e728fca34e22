@stof at first that was the idea, but I think it's easier and more convenient to do it with the installer. For example, this allows us to easily create a `README.md` file with the name of the project being created.

I've refactored the code to use `glob()` to detect the `UPGRADE` and `CHANGELOG` files to remove.
