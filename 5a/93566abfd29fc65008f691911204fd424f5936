@xabbuh I like your improvement, but we should rebase this PR and take into account the latest additions to the command, where you can omit the version and in that case we'll use the special version called `latest`

@javiereguiluz If you are talking about #29, that pull request is still pending. I don't see any other changes I could rebase this onto (the branch was forked after the last commit to `master`).

#29 is merged now.

It's rebased and takes the special `latest` version number into account.
